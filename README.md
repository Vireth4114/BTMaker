# BTMaker: A Bounce Tales Level Editor

This is my attempt to make a complete level editor for the 2008 Rovio Entertainment's game Bounce Tales on Java Phone

It has plenty of features but is far from polished

However it will never have:
- Code edition, I want this to be as accurate as possible to the original game, so I won't change the code
- Adding sprites or levels instead of editing them, it really saddens me that the sprite count was hardcoded into the game

You probably need at least Java 11 to run this
