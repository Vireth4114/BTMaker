# BTMaker: A Bounce Tales Level Editor

This is my attempt to make a complete level editor for the 2008 Rovio Entertainment's game Bounce Tales on Java Phone

It is rather basic for now, you can:
- Modify the geometry of the level (moving its children along the way)
- Move Bounce starting position

There's too much left to be done:
- Make it kinda works with mouse instead of touchpad
- Add support for all other objects, especially sprites and events
- Editing sprites, musics, and strings
- Make it pwetty

However it will never have:
- Code edition, I want this to be as accurate as possible to the original game, so I won't change the code
- Adding sprites or levels instead of editing them, it really saddens me that the sprite count was hardcoded into the game

You probably need at least Java 11 to run this
